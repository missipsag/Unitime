## Demo Video

A short screen recording demonstrating core flows is included in the repository as [Unitime_screen_recording.mp4](Unitime_screen_recording.mp4).

Embedded demo (click the image to open on YouTube):

Note: GitHub may sanitize or block iframes in README views; the clickable thumbnail works reliably.


If the embedded player does not display on your platform (GitHub may sanitize HTML in some views), open the file locally:

Linux:

```
xdg-open Unitime_screen_recording.mp4
```

macOS:

```
open Unitime_screen_recording.mp4
```

Or play in your preferred media player.
